# Heat_Index_Research

Hello. This code lets you compare Lu and Romps' (2022) Heat Index algorithm to others' (named in the notebooks. Lu and Romps' (2022) algorithm is available in Python, R, and Fortran code at https://romps.berkeley.edu/papers/pubs-2020-heatindex.html#:~:text=To%20extend%20the%20heat%20index,observable%20measure%20of%20physiological%20stress.

You will need some spatial data to run the code. I used ERA5-Land data at the hourly level for the Limpopo province of South Africa, with my  with a bounding box using this helpful tool: https://boundingbox.klokantech.com/.

The following notebooks (not python files â€“ for your editing convenience) need to be executed in order:
1. 1_ERA5-Land_Data_Requests.ipynb
   - You will need a Copernicus (CDS) account and to specify your CDS API Key. See the following link for a tutorial: https://ecmwf-projects.github.io/copernicus-training-c3s/cds-tutorial.html
2. 2_Creating_and_concatenating_cubes.ipynb
   - This will create Iris "cubes" out of the individually requested files from step 1
4. 3_Cube_creation_frontend.ipynb
   - Takes about 2+days to run for a Limpopo province-sized region
5. 4_Data_Analysis_frontend.ipynb

**Useful tips**
Don't worry about the equivalent "backend" files unless you'd like to make some changes to outputs
